# Blueno's Bakery README

### Link to Deployed App: https://blueno-bakery.vercel.app/

### Objective:
The objective of this project was to practice creating an app in React from scratch. 

In this processs, I learned how to think through an app's component heirarchy. This app contains an aggregator cart function, which functions by passing data between different components of the webpage. When a bakery item's "Add to Cart" button gets clicked, the item price is passed to the cart and the total price updates accordingly. 

### Visual Design:
I imported fonts and matching illustrations to establish a style for the webpage. I experimenting with using a kawaii style for this app. 

### Deployment:
I deployed using Vercel for this project.
